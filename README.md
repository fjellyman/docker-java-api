# docker-java-api

This project is based off of the [_Building a RESTful Web Service_](https://spring.io/guides/gs/rest-service/) by Spring.

The goal of this project is to be a simple REST API powered by Java and Spring. It's to be dockerized and ready to use in docker examples and workflows.

This is NOT to be used as best practice for Spring applications, and is only used for example/learning purposes.

## Installation 

The dependencies are configured to be used with Gradle. 

`gradle build`

## Startup

To run the application, simply use the Java CLI.

`java -jar build/libs/docker-java-api-0.1.0.jar`
